        <br>

        I\'m a ************ train wreck \n </br> <br>
I don\'t wanna be too much \n </br> <br>
But I don\'t wanna miss your touch \n </br> <br>
And you don\'t seem to give a **** \n </br> <br>
I don\'t wanna keep you waiting \n </br> <br>
But I do just what I have to do \n </br> <br>
And I might not be the one for you \n </br> <br>
But you ain\'t allowed to have no boo \n </br> <br>
 \n </br> <br>
Cause I know we be so complicated \n </br> <br>
But we be so *******, it\'s crazy \n </br> <br>
I can\'t have what I want, but neither can you \n </br> <br>
 \n </br> <br>
You ain\'t my boyfriend (Boyfriend) \n </br> <br>
And I ain\'t your girlfriend (Girlfriend) \n </br> <br>
But you don\'t want me to see nobody else \n </br> <br>
And I don\'t want you to see nobody \n </br> <br>
But you ain\'t my boyfriend (Boyfriend) \n </br> <br>
And I ain\'t your girlfriend (Girlfriend) \n </br> <br>
But you don\'t want me to touch nobody else \n </br> <br>
Baby, we ain\'t gotta tell nobody \n </br> <br>
 \n </br> <br>
Even though you ain\'t mine, I promise the way we fight \n </br> <br>
Make me honestly feel like we just in love \n </br> <br>
Cause, baby, when push comes to shove \n </br> <br>
Damn, baby, I\'m a train wreck, too (Too) \n </br> <br>
I lose my mind when it comes to you \n </br> <br>
I take time with the ones I choose \n </br> <br>
And I don\'t want a smile if it ain\'t from you, yeah \n </br> <br>
 \n </br> <br>
I know we be so complicated \n </br> <br>
Lovin you sometimes drive me crazy \n </br> <br>
Cause I can\'t have what I want and neither can you \n </br> <br>
 \n </br> <br>
You ain\'t my boyfriend (Boyfriend) \n </br> <br>
And I ain\'t your girlfriend (Girlfriend) \n </br> <br>
But you don\'t want me to see nobody else \n </br> <br>
And I don\'t want you to see nobody \n </br> <br>
But you ain\'t my boyfriend (Boyfriend) \n </br> <br>
And I ain\'t your girlfriend (Girlfriend) \n </br> <br>
But you don\'t want me to touch nobody else \n </br> <br>
Baby, we ain\'t gotta tell nobody \n </br> <br>
 \n </br> <br>
I wanna kiss you (Yeah), don\'t wanna miss you (Yeah) \n </br> <br>
But I can\'t be with you cause I got issues \n </br> <br>
Yeah, on the surface, seem like it\'s easy \n </br> <br>
Careful with words, but it\'s still hard to read me \n </br> <br>
Stress high when the trust low (Mmm) \n </br> <br>
Bad vibes, where\'d the fun go? (Oh) \n </br> <br>
Try to open up and love more (Love more) \n </br> <br>
Try to open up and love more \n </br> <br>
 \n </br> <br>
If you were my boyfriend \n </br> <br>
And you were my girlfriend \n </br> <br>
I prolly wouldn\'t see nobody else \n </br> <br>
But I can\'t guarantee that by myself \n </br> <br>
 \n </br> <br>
You ain\'t my boyfriend (Boyfriend, you ain\'t my boyfriend) \n </br> <br>
And I ain\'t your girlfriend (Girlfriend, I ain\'t your girlfriend) \n </br> <br>
But you don\'t want me to see nobody else (Nobody) \n </br> <br>
And I don\'t want you to see nobody \n </br> <br>
But you ain\'t my boyfriend (Boyfriend, you know you ain\'t my boyfriend) \n </br> <br>
And I ain\'t your girlfriend (Girlfriend, yeah, mmm) \n </br> <br>
But you don\'t want me to touch nobody else (Nobody) \n </br> <br>
Baby, we ain\'t gotta tell nobody (Oh yeah) \n </br> <br>
You ain\'t my boyfriend (Boyfriend) \n </br> <br>
And I ain\'t your girlfriend (Girlfriend) \n </br> <br>
But you don\'t want me to see nobody else \n </br> <br>
And I don\'t want you to see nobody \n </br> <br>
But you ain\'t my boyfriend (Boyfriend) \n </br> <br>
And I ain\'t your girlfriend (Girlfriend, yeah) \n </br> <br>
But you don\'t want me to touch nobody else (Nobody) \n </br> <br>
Baby, we ain\'t gotta tell nobody \n </br> <br>
